# 3DAugmentedRealityApp

Augmented reality application using Unity and Android

Goal: An application that will render 3D objects in a scene when a marker is presented to a camera


 	  Our project topic is the creation of a mobile graphical scene using augmented reality. Our goal was to design
 	 an application that will render 3D objects in a scene when a unique marker is presented to a camera. 
 	 We chose to use a $20 bill as a marker, and when the camera recognizes the bill, it projects the scene - a
 	 car on top of it, projected in a city with a few other views nearby, such as a mirrored view.
	  The graphics themselves were completed in Unity. We had to upload a digital rendering of the bill,
	 import models and scenes, and then create different lighting options and settings in order for the
	 view to be correct. We then set it to show our graphics when the bill is seen. Some of the different
	 views have more programming, such as the mirrored view. Here, we use a C# script modified from how
	 mirrored water is shown in Unity and have it so that the car is seen in a mirror nearby. We then
	 import the project into Android Studio in order to have it run on the device.
	  This was all implemented in either a pair-programming type style, where one would do something and
	 the other would advise, or, in the case of the Unity work, each team member programmed the same thing
	 at the same time. Even though only one construction of the graphics was used, we both gained a complete
	 understanding of how everything works, resulting in not only the full contribution of each team member,
	 but a great deal of knowledge, too. Things got more difficult once the main application was mostly complete,
	 as we were adding nitpicky things, but for the most part, continuous work was made by each member on it.
